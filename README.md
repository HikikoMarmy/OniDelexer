# OniDelexer
Converts Onigiri's .nut, .kwt, and .tlks files from bytecode to a readable format.

**How To**:
Simply drop your files onto the included Decompile_File.bat and it will attempt to decompile it.

**Note**:
I shouldn't need to say this, but the purpose of this tool is for future preservation.
It is **NOT** a tool to be used to cheat, modify, or harm the official game in any way.

Help Onigiri to stay alive.
